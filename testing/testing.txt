	The user base for the Adopt a Dog website are users that want to adopt a dog. The site has choices from many different sizes and breeds of dogs. The users might use PCs, Macs or mobile Android or IOS devices to view the website.

	The Adopt a Dog website was tested on browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Opera. It was made using graceful degradation. The site was also tested using the HTML5 Validator and emulators. The website uses percentages more than hard-coded pixels so that the content on the site adapts to different device sizes. All the text on the site is formatted so that it is big and easy to read.

       To test responsiveness of the website, the window was resized. Some changes made to improve testing responsiveness were adding another media query in the styles.css file so that when the website’s screen width is smaller on the “dogs” page, the dog’s cards are still an easy size to read. The footer was also changed to have more padding so that when the site is being viewed on smaller devices the text in the footer doesn’t run into the edges of the screen. Another change made while testing was adding a box-shadow to the ‘see-more-dogs’ button on the Index page so that it’s easier for users to tell that the button is a link.
